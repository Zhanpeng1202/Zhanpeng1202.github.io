I am Zhanpeng Luo, a third year computer science major student at University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). I spent 2 years at Sichuan University, and then I transfer to the Univerisity of Pittsburgh.

I am passionate about three-dimensional vision, real-time rendering and generative model. Specifically, I am currently work on the optimization process of gaussian splatting, towards training seamlessly on arbitrary large scene. I am currently supervised by Dr.Bernhard Kerbl.
