I am Zhanpeng Luo, a third year computer science major student at University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). I spent 2 years at Sichuan University, and then I transfer to the Univerisity of Pittsburgh.

I am interested in three-dimensional vision, real-time rendering and generative model. Specifically, I am working on the optimization process of gaussian splatting, towards training seamlessly on arbitrary large scene. Currently, I am supervised by [Dr.Bernhard Kerbl](https://snosixtyboo.github.io/).

In my spare time, I often cook. Here is some of my cuisines I made after I come to the United States, and I also work out. If you are at Okaland, Pittsburgh, we can play baskteball together at the Trees Hall.

If you would like to chat about life, cuisine, or CV, CG, or gaussian splatting, please directly send me a email.
